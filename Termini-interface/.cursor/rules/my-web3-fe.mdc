### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.

UI and Styling
Component Libraries
- Use headlessui/react UI for consistent, accessible component design.
- Integrate Radix UI primitives for customizable, accessible UI elements.
- Apply composition patterns to create modular, reusable components.

Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first, maintainable styling.
- Design with mobile-first, responsive principles for flexibility across devices.
- Implement dark mode using CSS variables or Tailwind’s dark mode features.
- Ensure color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards for readability.
- Maint
